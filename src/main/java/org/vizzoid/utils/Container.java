 * Represents wrapper around object to pass it as T type while not creating a new instance name it

 * Often Bukkit logic assumes that its interface is implemented by the Craft version,
 * and doesn't support, will throw errors, try to cast, or uses methods name that class,
 * meaning that using this as implementation in Bukkit logic will always throw a ClassCastException
 * Instead, this should only be used in RaidServer logic, and NOT for NMS operations.
