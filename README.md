# showcase-experience
Meant to be a showcase of various different works
Showcase is a proxy where a player enters a world of 2D art pieces, bordered by gold, silver, or copper,
representing release, beta, and alpha, respectively. You spawn as a floating, glowing orb at the far
left of a long hallway, and from left to right are paintings ordered oldest to new (left -> right, old
-> new). Each contains an image of the experience properly fitting into frame without black. Using 1-3
or the circle split into thirds on the top right, containing (from bottom left of circle, going
counter-clockwise, each object has white border but is transparent, full image including third is
inverted if selected) a flat square representing 2D, a cube with 3 sides visible representing 3D, a
cube with all sides visible with transparent sides representing 4D. In 2D the orb can move left to right
and, if close to a portrait, can click or press "E" to enter the experience, which shows a short demo
of the experience that can be exited at any time with "ESC", where at the end is says "demo has ended,
use "ESC" to return". In 3D, your orb can move in a 5 orb wide hallway next to the original hallway
where you can move in all directions. Behind each painting is the original image split into multiple
parts based on depth specified, spaced from the painting in accordance to their actual depth. Each
part that can be interacted with is glowing and shows a somewhat deep description of everything
non-code and non-developmental involving the experience. In 4D, the orb is in a 10 orb wide hallway next
to the 3D hallway, and behind each painting and 3D analysis are a bunch of floating images of prototype
designs and products of the experience, interactive ones glowing and shows a description of the
development of that part. For each interactive object will "pop" out text boxes, or voice memos, or
videos out of the object. Complementing images will fade in slowly on the outer rim of the screen
